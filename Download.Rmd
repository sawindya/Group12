#TIP: To download a file with R, click on “view raw” and then you can copy the URL from the address bar and then use the download.file command in R.
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/main/gene_expression.tsv"
destfile <- "gene_expression.tsv"
download.file(url, destfile)

```
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/main/growth_data.csv"
destfile <- "growth_data.csv"
download.file(url, destfile)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
