#TIP: To download a file with R, click on “view raw” and then you can copy the URL from the address bar and then use the download.file command in R.
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/main/gene_expression.tsv"
destfile <- "gene_expression.tsv"
download.file(url, destfile)

```
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/main/growth_data.csv"
destfile <- "growth_data.csv"
download.file(url, destfile)
```
#1.Read in the file, making the gene identifiers the row names. Show a table of values for the first six genes#
```{r}
# Read the gene_expression.tsv file using read.table 
gene_expression <- read.table("gene_expression.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1) 
# Show a table of values for the first six genes 
head(gene_expression, 6)

```
#2.Make a new column which is the mean of the other columns. Show a table of values for the first six genes#
```{r}
# Assuming gene_expression is already loaded
# Calculate the mean of the gene expression values (excluding row names) 
gene_expression$mean_expression <- rowMeans(gene_expression)
# Show a table of values for the first six genes, including the new mean column 
head(gene_expression, 6)

```
#3.List the 10 genes with the highest mean expression#
```{r}
# Assuming the mean_expression column has already been added
# Order the data frame by the mean expression in descending order
top_genes <- gene_expression[order(-gene_expression$mean_expression), ]

# Select the top 10 genes
top_10_genes <- head(top_genes, 10)

# Display the top 10 genes with their mean expression values
top_10_genes
```
#4.Determine the number of genes with a mean <10#
```{r}
# Assuming the mean_expression column has already been added
# Count the number of genes with mean expression less than 10
num_genes_below_10 <- sum(gene_expression$mean_expression < 10)

# Display the result
num_genes_below_10
```
#5.Make a histogram plot of the mean values and include it into your report#
```{r}
# Create a histogram of the mean expression values using base R
hist(gene_expression$mean_expression,
     breaks = 20,             # Number of bins
     col = "blue",           # Fill color
     border = "black",       # Border color
     main = "Histogram of Mean Gene Expression", # Title
     xlab = "Mean Expression", # x-axis label
     ylab = "Frequency")      # y-axis label
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
